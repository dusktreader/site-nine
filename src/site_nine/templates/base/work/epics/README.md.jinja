# Epics

This directory contains epic files documenting large-scale feature initiatives for {{ project_name }}.

Each epic is a separate markdown file that groups related tasks and provides high-level tracking.

## Epic File Naming

**Format:** `EPC-<PRIORITY>-<NUMBER>.md`

**Examples:**
- `EPC-H-0001.md` (High priority, epic #1)
- `EPC-M-0002.md` (Medium priority, epic #2)
- `EPC-L-0003.md` (Low priority, epic #3)

**Components:**
- `EPC` - Epic prefix (constant)
- `<PRIORITY>` - Priority code:
  - `H` - High priority
  - `M` - Medium priority
  - `L` - Low priority
- `<NUMBER>` - Zero-padded sequential number (4 digits)

**Priority Guidelines:**
- **High (H):** Critical features, blockers, or technical debt that impacts development
- **Medium (M):** Important features that improve functionality or user experience
- **Low (L):** Nice-to-have features, minor improvements, or future enhancements

## Epic File Structure

Each epic file follows this structure:

```markdown
# Epic EPC-<PRIORITY>-<NUMBER>: <Title>

**Status:** 📋 TODO | 🔄 UNDERWAY | ✅ COMPLETE | ❌ CANCELLED
**Priority:** HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
**Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS


## Description

Brief overview of what this epic encompasses and why it's needed.

## Goals

- Specific outcome 1
- Specific outcome 2
- Specific outcome 3

## Success Criteria

- Measurable criterion 1
- Measurable criterion 2
- Measurable criterion 3

## Related Architecture

- **ADR-XXX**: Link to relevant Architecture Decision Records
- Reference to design documents or technical specifications

## Notes

Additional context, background information, or important considerations.

## Managing Epics

**List all epics:**
```bash
s9 dashboard
```

**Show epic details:**
```bash
s9 epic show EPC-H-0001
```

**Create new epic:**
```bash
s9 epic create --title "Feature Name" --priority HIGH
```

**Update epic:**
```bash
s9 epic update EPC-H-0001 --status UNDERWAY
```

## Epic Lifecycle

### Creating an Epic

1. Administrator identifies a large-scale initiative
2. Create epic file with appropriate priority
3. Define clear goals and success criteria
4. Link to relevant architecture decisions (ADRs)
5. Break down into specific tasks for various roles

### During Development

- Track progress through subtasks in the dashboard
- Update status as work progresses (TODO → UNDERWAY)
- Document decisions and adjustments in Notes section
- Keep Related Architecture section up to date

### Completing an Epic

1. Verify all success criteria are met
2. Ensure all subtasks are completed or closed
3. Update status to COMPLETE
4. Document outcomes and lessons learned
5. Reference epic in related commit messages and PRs

## Epic Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `📋 TODO` | Epic defined but work not yet started |
| `🔄 UNDERWAY` | Active development in progress |
| `✅ COMPLETE` | All goals met and success criteria satisfied |
| `❌ CANCELLED` | Epic abandoned or deprioritized |

## Relationship with Tasks

Epics serve as parent containers for related tasks:

- Each task references its parent epic (if applicable)
- Use `s9 task create --epic EPC-H-0001` to link tasks to epics
- Dashboard shows epic progress based on subtask completion
- Tasks can span multiple roles (Architect, Engineer, Tester, etc.)


---


## Benefits

1. **Strategic Planning** - Organize work around meaningful features
2. **Progress Tracking** - See high-level completion status at a glance
3. **Context Preservation** - Goals and success criteria documented upfront
4. **Cross-Role Coordination** - Multiple agents contribute to single epic
5. **Architecture Alignment** - Links to ADRs ensure technical coherence
6. **Historical Record** - Understand why features were built and how
