## Objective

Restructure .opencode directory to clearly separate prompts/instructions, tracking documents, and data storage

Reorganize .opencode/ to create clear separation between: (1) Prompts/Instructions/Static Docs - agent definitions, guides, procedures that don't change during work (e.g., agents/, guides/, procedures/); (2) Tracking Documents - files updated during development like PROJECT_STATUS.md, session files, task artifacts that track work in progress; (3) Data Storage - databases, caches, non-document files like project.db. Propose new directory structure with clear naming and purpose. Create migration plan for moving existing files. Update all references in code and documentation. Consider directories like: .opencode/prompts/, .opencode/tracking/, .opencode/data/, or similar clear naming. Document the new structure in README.md with clear guidelines on what goes where.
