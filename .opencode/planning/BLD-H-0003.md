## Objective

Update s9 to dynamically locate .opencode directory from pwd instead of hardcoded paths

Modify s9 CLI to search for .opencode directory starting from current working directory and walking up the directory tree until found (similar to how git finds .git). This makes s9 work in any project codebase regardless of where it's installed. Update path resolution logic for: task files (.opencode/planning/), agent definitions (.opencode/agents/), session files (.opencode/sessions/), and database (.opencode/data/project.db). Add error handling for when .opencode is not found.
