# Custom Commands & Skills

This directory contains custom OpenCode commands that leverage skills for standardized workflows.

> **Note on Task ID Format:** This document contains examples using the old task ID format (e.g., H027, H038). 
> The current format is `PREFIX-PRIORITY-NUMBER` (e.g., OPR-H-0001, BLD-C-0005). 
> Task IDs are now **auto-generated** by the `s9 task create` command.
> See `.opencode/skills/task-management/SKILL.md` for details.

## What Are Commands & Skills?

**Commands** are slash commands (like `/summon`) that users type in OpenCode to trigger specific workflows.

**Skills** are reusable instruction sets that agents load to follow complex, multi-step procedures.

Together, they provide a powerful way to standardize and simplify common development workflows.

## Available Commands

### Session Management

#### `/summon` - Start New Mission

**Purpose:** Initialize a new development mission with proper role selection and persona naming.

**Usage:**
```
/summon
/summon <role>
```

**Examples:**
- `/summon` - Interactive mode: asks you to choose a role
- `/summon operator` - Direct mode: starts an Operator session immediately
- `/summon builder` - Direct mode: starts a Builder session immediately

**What it does:**
1. (If no role provided) Asks you to choose a role (Administrator, Architect, Builder, Tester, etc.)
2. Suggests a persona name from mythology appropriate to your role
3. Checks for name conflicts with existing missions
4. Creates a mission file with proper metadata
5. Reads essential project documentation
6. Shows available tasks for your role

**Example interaction (interactive mode):**
```
User: /summon

Agent: Which role should I assume for this mission?
- Administrator (coordination & delegation)
- Architect (design & planning)
- Builder (implementation)
- Tester (validation & QA)
- Documentarian (docs & guides)
- Designer (UI/UX)
- Inspector (review & audit)
- Operator (deployment & infrastructure)

User: Builder

Agent: I suggest the persona "goibniu" for this Builder mission.
(Goibniu is the Celtic god of metalworking and craft)

Would you like to use this persona, or choose a different one?

User: That's perfect!

Agent: ✅ Mission initialized!

I'm Goibniu, your Builder persona for this mission.

[Session continues...]
```

**Example interaction (direct mode):**
```
User: /summon operator

Agent: I suggest the persona "hemera" for this Operator mission.
(Hemera is the Greek goddess of day)

Would you like to use this persona, or choose a different one?

User: yes

Agent: ✅ Mission initialized!

I'm Hemera, your Operator persona for this mission.

[Session continues...]
```

**Pro tip:** Use direct mode (`/summon <role>`) to skip the role selection and start working faster!

---

#### `/dismiss` - End Current Mission

**Purpose:** Properly close a development mission with cleanup and documentation.

   - Outcomes (✅ completed, ⚠️ partial, ❌ blocked)
   - Next steps for future work
4. Closes any open tasks in the task database
5. Verifies task artifacts are updated
6. Commits the mission file
7. Provides a summary of the mission
8. Says goodbye

**Example interaction:**
```
User: /dismiss

Agent: Closing mission...

[Agent checks git status, recent commits, open tasks...]

I've updated the mission file with:
- End time: 15:30:00
- Duration: ~2.5 hours
- Status: completed

Files changed:
- src/s9/main.py - Added rate limiting

- **COMPLETE:** 55 tasks

**For your role (Tester):**
- 1 TODO task: H003 - Validate Rate Limiting Functionality
- 1 UNDERWAY: H035 (claimed by themis)

**Recommendations:**
You could claim H003 if you're ready to work on rate limiting validation.

Would you like to:
1. See details? `cd .opencode/tasks && ./tasks.py show H003`
2. Claim H003? Use `/claim-task`
3. Filter by status/priority? I can show just TODO, just HIGH, etc.
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Starting a session - see what work is available
- ✅ Planning - understand project state
- ✅ Looking for work - find TODO tasks for your role
- ✅ Checking progress - see what's UNDERWAY or BLOCKED

**What you see:**
- **All tasks** by priority (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
- **Status** (TODO, UNDERWAY, BLOCKED, COMPLETE, etc.)
- **Role** assignment
- **Agent** currently working on it
- **Creation dates**
- **Summary metrics**

**Follow-up actions:**
- Use `/claim-task` to claim a TODO task
- Use `./tasks.py show TASK_ID` for full details
- Filter by role, status, or priority if needed

#### `/commit` - Commit & Push Changes

**Purpose:** Commit changes and push to origin following project standards (QA, task artifacts, Conventional Commits).

**Usage:**
```
/commit
```

**What it does:**
1. Runs QA checks (`make qa/full`)
2. Reviews git status and diff to see what's changing
3. Prompts you to update task artifact with implementation details
4. Guides you through creating a Conventional Commits message with agent attribution and task reference
5. Commits the changes
6. Pushes to origin

**Example interaction:**
```
User: /commit

Agent: I'll commit and push your changes following project standards.

Step 1: Running QA checks...

$ make qa/full
[Running tests, linting, type checking...]
✅ All quality checks pass!

Step 2: Reviewing changes...

$ git status

#### `/handoff` - Hand Off to Another Persona

**Purpose:** Transfer work to another persona with full context and documentation.

**Usage:**
```
/handoff [Role]
```

**What it does:**
1. Identifies your current role and persona
2. Determines target role (or asks if not specified)
3. Gathers current state (git status, active tasks, recent commits)
4. Creates structured handoff document with:
   - What was done
   - Current state
   - What needs to be done next
   - Files to review
   - Approach and constraints
   - Acceptance criteria
5. Saves handoff as `.pending.md` file in `.opencode/work/missions/handoffs/`
6. Updates your mission file with handoff info
7. Provides instructions for recipient

**Example interaction:**
```
User: /handoff Builder

Agent (Administrator - Ishtar): Creating handoff to Builder...

Gathering current state...
- Branch: feature/query-caching
- Uncommitted: 0 files
- Active task: None
- Recent work: Created task H040, reviewed requirements

What should the Builder focus on?

User: Implement database query caching for H040

Agent: Creating handoff document...

✅ Handoff created successfully!

**From:** Administrator (Ishtar)
**To:** Builder (any)
**Created:** 2026-01-29 16:30:00

**Handoff Document:**
.opencode/work/missions/handoffs/2026-01-29.16:30:00.manager-ishtar.builder.pending.md

**Summary:**
- Task: H040 - Implement database query caching
- Priority: HIGH
- Estimated: 4-6 hours
- Approach: Redis-based caching with graceful degradation
- Files to review: 4 files
- Acceptance criteria: 7 items

**For Next Persona:**
When Builder starts with `/summon`, they'll be notified of this handoff
and can read the full context.

**Your Options:**
- Continue working on other tasks
- Use `/dismiss` to end your mission
- Create another handoff if needed

Handoff document includes:
✅ Full context (what was done, current state)
✅ Clear task definition (H040 with details)
✅ Recommended approach (step-by-step)
✅ Files to review (with line numbers)
✅ Gotchas and constraints
✅ Acceptance criteria checklist
✅ Next steps for recipient
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Administrator delegates implementation to Builder
- ✅ Builder hands off to Tester for validation
- ✅ Tester finds bugs and hands back to Builder
- ✅ Builder completes feature and hands to Inspector for review
- ✅ Any time work needs to transition between roles

**What gets handed off:**
- **Context:** What was done and why
- **State:** Current branch, files, tasks, commits
- **Task:** Specific task ID and requirements
- **Approach:** Recommended implementation strategy
- **Constraints:** Important limitations or requirements
- **Criteria:** How to know when it's done
- **Resources:** Files to review, docs to read, related work

**Handoff lifecycle:**
1. **Created (`.pending.md`)** - Waiting for recipient persona
2. **Accepted (`.accepted.md`)** - Recipient started work (via `/summon`)
3. **Completed (`.completed.md`)** - Work finished (via `/dismiss`)

**Integration with other commands:**
- `/summon` checks for pending handoffs and offers to accept them
- `/dismiss` marks accepted handoffs as completed
- `/claim-task` can be used after accepting handoff

---

## How It Works

### Command → Skill Flow

1. **User types command:** `/summon`
2. **OpenCode loads command file:** `.opencode/commands/summon.md`
3. **Command tells agent:** "Load the session-start skill"
4. **Agent calls skill tool:** `skill({ name: "session-start" })`
5. **OpenCode loads skill:** `.opencode/skills/session-start/SKILL.md`
6. **Agent follows skill instructions:** Role selection → naming → mission creation → doc reading

### Why This Design?

**Commands** provide:
- ✅ Easy discoverability (users can type `/` to see all commands)
- ✅ Simple invocation (just `/summon` instead of explaining the process)
- ✅ Consistent entry points across all personas

**Skills** provide:
- ✅ Detailed, step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Reusable across multiple commands if needed
- ✅ Version-controlled standardization
- ✅ Easy to update without changing command files

---

## Creating New Commands & Skills

Want to add more standardized workflows? Here's how:

### 1. Identify a Repetitive Workflow

Look for tasks that:
- Personas do repeatedly
- Have multiple steps
- Need consistency
- Can be standardized

**Examples:**
- Committing changes (run QA, update task artifact, format commit message)
- Creating architecture decisions (write ADR, update docs, link issues)
- Reviewing code (scan for issues, check patterns, generate report)
- Creating tasks (validate format, check dependencies, create files)

### 2. Create the Command File

**Location:** `.opencode/commands/your-command.md`

**Template:**
```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this command does
agent: <optional-role-preference>
---

Load the <skill-name> skill and follow its instructions to <accomplish goal>.
```

**Example:** `.opencode/commands/commit.md`
```markdown
---
description: Commit changes following project standards
agent: builder
---

Load the commit-workflow skill and follow its instructions to commit the current changes.
```

### 3. Create the Skill File

**Location:** `.opencode/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

**Template:**
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description (1-2 sentences)
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  audience: <target-agents>
  workflow: <workflow-type>
---

## What I Do

## When to Use Me

[When should agents load this skill?]

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: [First Action]
[Detailed instructions...]

### Step 2: [Second Action]
[Detailed instructions...]

## Important Notes

- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]

## Examples

[Show example usage if helpful]
```

### 4. Test the Command

1. Start OpenCode in the project
2. Type `/your-command`
3. Verify the agent loads the skill
4. Verify the agent follows the instructions
5. Check that the outcome is correct

### 5. Document It

Add your command to this README with:
- Command name and purpose
- Usage example
- What it does (step by step)
- Example interaction

---

## Best Practices

### For Commands

- ✅ Keep command files simple (just load the skill)
- ✅ Use descriptive command names (`/summon` not `/start`)
- ✅ Write clear descriptions for the TUI
- ✅ Specify agent if the command is role-specific

### For Skills

- ✅ Be explicit and detailed in instructions
- ✅ Include validation steps
- ✅ Show example commands with actual syntax
- ✅ Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- ✅ Include common gotchas and edge cases
- ✅ Keep instructions in logical order
- ✅ Use sections and headers for clarity

### For Both

- ✅ Test with actual personas before committing
- ✅ Keep instructions up to date
- ✅ Version control both files together
- ✅ Document in this README

---

## Skill Permissions

You can control which skills personas can access in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "skill": {
      "*": "allow",              // Allow all skills by default
      "experimental-*": "ask"    // Ask before loading experimental skills
    }
  }
}
```

**Permission levels:**
- `allow` - Skill loads immediately
- `deny` - Skill is hidden and blocked
- `ask` - User is prompted for approval

Currently, all skills in this project use `allow` (no restrictions).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Command not showing up in TUI

- Verify file is in `.opencode/commands/`
- Verify filename is `<command-name>.md`
- Verify frontmatter has `description` field
- Restart OpenCode if needed

### Agent not loading skill

- Verify skill file is in `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Verify filename is exactly `SKILL.md` (all caps)
- Verify frontmatter has required `name` and `description` fields
- Verify `name` in frontmatter matches directory name
- Check permissions in `opencode.json`

### Skill name validation errors

Skill names must:
- Be 1-64 characters
- Be lowercase alphanumeric with single hyphen separators
- Not start or end with `-`
- Not contain consecutive `--`
- Match: `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`

**Valid:** `session-start`, `commit-workflow`, `create-adr`
**Invalid:** `Session-Start`, `commit--workflow`, `-create-adr`, `adr-`
