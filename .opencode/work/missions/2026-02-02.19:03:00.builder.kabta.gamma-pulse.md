# Session: Fix Role Dashboard Filter

**Persona:** Kabta (Builder)
**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Duration:** 19:03:00 - 19:12:36 (~10 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Fix the `s9 dashboard --role` command to show only available tasks (TODO and UNDERWAY) instead of all tasks including completed ones.

## Work Log

### 19:03 - Session Started
- Role: Builder
- Name: kabta
- Awaiting direction from user

### 19:06 - Fixed Role Dashboard Filter
- Issue identified: `s9 dashboard --role [Role]` was showing all tasks including completed ones
- Updated `/src/s9/cli/dashboard.py` to filter tasks to only TODO and UNDERWAY statuses when role filter is active
- Changed variable name from `all_tasks` to `available_tasks` for clarity
- Updated message from "No tasks available" to "No available tasks" for consistency
- Tested with Builder (no tasks), Operator (1 UNDERWAY), and Documentarian (2 TODO) roles
- Committed changes

### 19:12 - Session End
- Updated session file with outcomes
- Ready to close session
