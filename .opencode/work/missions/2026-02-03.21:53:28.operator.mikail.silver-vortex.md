## Outcomes

✅ **Mission cleanup complete:**
- Closed 13 stale/abandoned missions
- Active missions reduced from 14 to 1
- Database cleaned and consistent

✅ **Abandoned work detection implemented:**
- Added Check 5 to `s9 doctor` command
- Detects tasks abandoned by ended missions (auto-fixable)
- Detects orphaned UNDERWAY tasks (warning)
- Detects stale active missions >48 hours (warning)
- Integrated with existing `--fix` and `--verbose` flags

✅ **Tasks completed:**
- OPR-H-0048: Clean up stale missions (COMPLETE)
- OPR-M-0031: Add abandoned work detection to doctor (COMPLETE)
- DES-M-0022: Create AI image prompts (COMPLETE)
- DOC-M-0027: Add Mimir portrait (COMPLETE)

✅ **Quality assurance:**
- Tested abandoned work detection with real data
- Verified fix functionality with `s9 doctor --fix`
- Confirmed detection accuracy with verbose output

## Next Steps

None - work is complete. The automated abandoned work detection will prevent future mission list clutter.

## Notes

This mission demonstrated the value of the abandoned work detection feature by manually performing the cleanup that the feature will now automate. The work completed in this session will prevent similar manual cleanup from being necessary in the future.
