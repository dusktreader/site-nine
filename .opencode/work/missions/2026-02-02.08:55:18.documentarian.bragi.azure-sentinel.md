### 09:01 - Synced to Database
- Successfully synced 61 new names to project database (147 → 208)

## Outcomes

- ✅ Completed DOC-M-0002: Expand daemon name collection

  - Added 20 Historian role names (ready for future schema migration)

- ✅ All changes committed to git with detailed commit message

## Next Steps

### For Future Agents:
1. **Schema Migration for Historian Role**: Update database CHECK constraints to include 'Historian' role in:
   - `daemon_names` table
   - `agents` table
   - Then sync 20 Historian names from JSON to database

2. **Testing**: Consider testing name suggestions work correctly with new names:
   - `s9 name suggest <Role>` for each role
   - Verify diversity in suggestions

3. **Documentation**: If desired, update any documentation that references specific daemon names to reflect the expanded collection

## Notes

Mission started with /summon command.
