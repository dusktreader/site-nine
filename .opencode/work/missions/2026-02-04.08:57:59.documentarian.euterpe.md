## Objective

Create comprehensive glossary page in docs/ to explain key site-nine concepts and terminology.

## Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive glossary document (`docs/source/glossary.md`) containing 40+ terms covering all major site-nine concepts. The glossary serves as a centralized reference for users to understand the system's terminology, workflows, and mental models.

## Outcomes

✅ **Task DOC-M-0056 - COMPLETE**
- Created comprehensive glossary covering:
  - Core concepts (Persona, Role, Mission, Task, Epic, Handoff, Review, etc.)
  - Identifiers (Task ID, Epic ID, Codename)
  - Status values and priorities
  - System components (Dashboard, Session, Database, .opencode directory)
  - Workflow concepts (Dependency, Claim, Changelog, ADR)
  - Operations (s9 CLI, /summon command)
  - Best practices and troubleshooting

- Each entry includes:
  - Clear definition
  - Key characteristics
  - Usage examples with code blocks
  - Cross-references to related concepts
  - Links to detailed documentation

- Added glossary to mkdocs.yaml navigation
- Verified docs build successfully (92KB HTML output)
- Committed changes with descriptive commit message

## Tasks Completed

- **DOC-M-0056** - Create glossary page in docs/ to explain key concepts ✅

## Decisions Made

1. **Glossary Structure**: Organized by concept type rather than alphabetically
   - Rationale: Logical grouping helps users find related concepts together
   - Categories match user mental models (Core → Identifiers → Workflows)

2. **Entry Format**: Comprehensive entries with examples and cross-references
   - Rationale: Users need more than just definitions
   - Examples show practical usage
   - Cross-references enable exploration

3. **Navigation Placement**: Positioned before CLI Reference
   - Rationale: Glossary provides foundational understanding
   - CLI Reference is more technical and detailed
   - Natural flow: concepts → details

4. **Mythology Section**: Included cultural context about persona names
   - Rationale: Helps users understand the naming system
   - Adds personality and richness to the documentation
   - Explains the "why" behind 145+ names

## Knowledge Shared

- Comprehensive terminology reference for all site-nine concepts
- Clear explanations of Task ID and Epic ID formats
- Status and priority meanings with visual symbols
- Workflow patterns and best practices
- Troubleshooting resources

## Handoffs

None - no handoffs received or created during this mission.

## Next Steps

None - work is complete. The glossary is ready for users.

**Future enhancements** (not part of this task):
- Could add more visual diagrams for complex concepts
- Could expand ADR section with examples
- Could add FAQ section linking to glossary terms

## Notes

- Mission was focused and efficient (~7 minutes)
- Task was well-scoped and clear
- No blockers encountered
- Documentation builds cleanly
- All Documentarian tasks now complete according to dashboard

## Reflection

This was a straightforward documentation task that benefited from:
- Clear task description with specific requirements
- Well-organized existing documentation to reference
- Good tooling (mkdocs, uv) that made verification easy
- Existing patterns to follow from other doc files

The glossary fills an important gap in the documentation by providing a centralized reference for terminology that was previously scattered across multiple pages.
