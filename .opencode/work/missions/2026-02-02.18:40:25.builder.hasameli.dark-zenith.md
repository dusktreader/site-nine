# Session: Add Role Filter to Dashboard

**Persona:** Hasameli (Builder)
**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Duration:** 18:40:25 - 18:53 (~13 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Add `--role` option to `s9 dashboard` command to filter tasks by role, and update the session-start skill to use this filtered dashboard view.

## Work Log

### 18:40 - Session Started
- Role: Builder
- Name: hasameli
- Awaiting direction from user

### 18:42 - Discussed Dashboard Enhancement
- Director noticed that session-start sequence doesn't show available tasks for selected role
- Discussed design options for implementing this feature
- Decided on Option A: Add `--role` filter to existing `s9 dashboard` command

### 18:45 - Implemented Dashboard Role Filter
- Added `--role` parameter to `dashboard_command()` function
- Removed unreachable dead code (lines 133-253)
- Updated task retrieval to use role filter: `task_manager.list_tasks(role=role)`
- Modified "Recent Tasks" table title to show role when filtered
- Added role-specific "no tasks" message

### 18:50 - Tested Implementation
- Tested with Builder role: Shows 4 completed tasks
- Tested with Designer role: Shows 1 TODO task
- Tested with Tester role: Shows "No tasks for Tester role" message
- All tests passed successfully

### 18:52 - Updated Session-Start Skill
- Modified Step 8 in `.opencode/skills/session-start/SKILL.md`
- Changed from `s9 task list --role [Role]` to `s9 dashboard --role [Role]`
- Updated instructions to show full dashboard with role-filtered tasks
- Added guidance for different scenarios (TODO exists, all complete, no tasks)

### 18:53 - Committed Changes
- Created commit with all changes
- Commit message: "feat(dashboard): add role filter to dashboard command"
- All changes successfully committed

### 18:53 - Session End
- Updated session file with outcomes
- All work complete, no open tasks

## Files Changed

- `src/s9/cli/dashboard.py` - Added role filter functionality, removed dead code
- `.opencode/skills/session-start/SKILL.md` - Updated Step 8 to use dashboard command
- `.opencode/work/sessions/2026-02-02.18:40:25.builder.hasameli.initial-session.md` - This session file

## Outcomes

- ✅ Dashboard role filter implemented and tested
- ✅ Added `--role/-r` option to `s9 dashboard` command
- ✅ Role-specific task filtering works correctly (tested with Builder, Designer, Tester)
- ✅ Table title shows role when filtered
- ✅ Role-specific "no tasks" message displays correctly
- ✅ Removed 120+ lines of unreachable dead code
- ✅ Session-start skill updated to use new dashboard feature
