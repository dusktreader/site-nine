## Work Log

### 15:56 - Mission Start
- Summoned as Israfil, Documentarian persona
- Generated and saved whimsical bio for Israfil
- Renamed OpenCode session to "Operation mystic-vortex: Israfil - Documentarian"
- Checked dashboard: 5 documentarian tasks available

### 15:57 - Received Requirements
Director requested documentation updates:
- Update tagline to "The headquarters for AI agent orchestration"
- Update "How It Works" to use `s9 summon` command
- Fix YAML config in quickstart to match actual structure
- Update "Next Steps" to explain both summon methods
- Add "The Director" terminology throughout
- Replace "You" with "The Director (You)"

### 15:58 - Fixed Circular Import
- Discovered `s9` command failing with circular import error
- Fixed by removing eager `_register_subcommands()` call at module level
- Updated import from `name` to `persona` (module was renamed)
- Added backwards compatibility alias for `name` command

### 16:00 - Documentation Updates
- Updated tagline in both `docs/source/index.md` and `README.md`
- Changed "How It Works" to showcase `s9 summon` as primary method
- Fixed YAML config example to match actual `SiteNineConfig` structure
- Updated "Next Steps" with two summon options (direct vs slash command)
- Added prominent "The Director (You)" section explaining role
- Replaced all "You" references with "The Director (You)" in examples

### 16:04 - Created Follow-up Task
- Created DOC-M-0112: "Create dedicated OpenCode slash commands reference page"
- Task for future work to document slash commands comprehensively

### 16:06 - Mission End
**Dismissal message:** "Nope! Thanks for your hard work! The docs site looks so much better!"

- Updated mission file
- Preparing to commit changes
- No tasks claimed during this mission

## Outcomes

✅ All requested documentation updates completed:
- Tagline updated consistently across docs
- `s9 summon` command properly showcased
- YAML config corrected to match actual structure
- "The Director" terminology introduced and applied
- Slash commands briefly documented with pointer for future enhancement

✅ Fixed critical bug:
- Resolved circular import preventing `s9` command from working

## Next Steps

None - documentation work complete. Follow-up task DOC-M-0112 created for future slash commands reference page.

## Technical Notes

**Circular Import Fix:** The issue was caused by `_register_subcommands()` being called at module level in `main.py` while `__init__.py` was still importing. Solution was to defer the call until after `__init__.py` completes its import, preventing the circular dependency.

**Config Structure:** The actual `SiteNineConfig` uses `session_tracking` and `daemon_naming`, not `mission_tracking` and `persona_naming`. The `persona_roles` array is not part of the config structure.
