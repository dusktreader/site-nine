# Mission: Storm-Apex

**Persona:** Raijin (Operator)
**Codename:** storm-apex
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Duration:** 22:45:07 - active

## Objective

General operations and infrastructure support

## Work Log

### 22:45 - Mission Started
- Persona: raijin
- Role: Operator
- Codename: storm-apex
- Mission ID: 49
- Awaiting direction from user

### 22:46 - Received Handoff

**From:** Operator (Oceanus)
**Handoff Document:** `.opencode/work/missions/handoffs/2026-02-03.22:42:49.operator-oceanus.operator.accepted.md`
**Task:** Testing session-start skill (no formal task ID)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated:** 30-45 minutes

**Summary:**
Oceanus fixed a critical bug in the session-start skill where agents were skipping the UUID generation step (Step 6a), causing session renames to use unreliable fallback detection and rename the wrong OpenCode session. The skill has been updated to combine Steps 6 & 7 into a single "2-step process" with prominent warnings to make it impossible to skip UUID generation.

**What I need to do:**
Test the updated session-start skill to verify the UUID generation workflow is clear and impossible to skip.

**Files to Review:**
- `.opencode/skills/session-start/SKILL.md` (lines 310-378) - Updated Step 6
- `src/site_nine/cli/mission.py` (lines 1023-1117) - rename_tui command implementation

**Testing Approach:**
1. Start fresh session with `/summon operator` ✅ (currently executing)
2. Follow Step 6 carefully - Step 6a (generate UUID) then Step 6b (rename with UUID)
3. Verify the correct session was renamed
4. Document experience - was it clear? Could I skip Step 6a?
5. Report findings

**Next Steps:**
- Continue following session-start skill workflow
- Pay attention to Step 6 clarity
- Complete handoff testing and provide feedback
