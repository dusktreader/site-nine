## Notes

Mission started with /summon command.

**Context from Previous Sessions:**
- 9 daemon image prompts were created in prior sessions
- All 9 portraits have been generated via Gemini
- User requested Mimir's prompt be fixed (vest/cardigan didn't fit aesthetics)
- User requested all image filenames be lowercase

**Daemon Portrait Summary:**
All 9 agent daemon portraits are ready for documentation:
1. Argus (Inspector) - Multiple glowing eyes
2. Azazel (Engineer) - Circuit patterns  
3. Mephistopheles (Administrator) - Obsidian horns
4. Kothar (Architect) - Geometric tattoos
5. Eris (Tester) - Heterochromatic eyes
6. Astarte (Designer) - TWO horns with circuits
7. Nammu (Operator) - Oceanic energy
8. Nabu (Documentarian) - Cuneiform patterns
9. Mimir (Historian) - Ice-blue eyes, elderly scholar

**Documentation Strategy:**
Recommended creating a dedicated `roles.md` page for comprehensive presentation of all 8 primary roles, with Mimir placed separately in the CLI reference near changelog documentation.
