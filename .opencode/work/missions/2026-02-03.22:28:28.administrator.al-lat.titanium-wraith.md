# Mission: titanium-wraith

**Persona:** Al-Lat (Administrator)
**Codename:** titanium-wraith
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Duration:** 22:28:28 - 23:57 (~1.5 hours)

## Objective

Review and approve adapter pattern ADRs, coordinate next steps for multi-tool support implementation.

## Work Log

### 22:28 - Mission Started
- Persona: al-lat
- Role: Administrator
- Codename: titanium-wraith
- Initialized session via session-start skill

### 22:30 - Review System Check
- Checked for pending reviews (found review #1)
- Discovered review list missing artifact column - created task OPR-H-0053

### 22:40 - ADR-001 Review (Adapter Pattern Abstraction)
- Wrapped markdown to 120 characters
- Removed gradual migration requirement (focused migration with Operators instead)
- Kept zero regression requirement (all features must work)
- Added comprehensive documentation update requirement
- Replaced all Cursor/Aider references with Copilot CLI/Crush/Claude Code
- Added testing limitations to risks (can't run integration tests)
- Added versioning complexity concern
- Aligned Risks & Mitigation table for readability
- Created DOC-M-0055 task for markdown style guide
- Approved review #1

### 23:19 - ADR-002 Complete Rewrite (Target Tool Prioritization)
- Completely rewrote ADR-002 to replace Cursor MCP focus
- Priority: Copilot CLI → Crush → Claude Code
- Emphasized sequential learning as essential strategy
- Added flexibility: if Claude Code available early, do it second
- Noted Crush as proving ground, may abandon if too difficult
- Removed community adapter marketplace (first-class citizens only)
- Created and approved review #5

### 23:33 - ADR-003 Rejection (Unified Configuration System)
- Rejected as premature - insufficient knowledge of target tools
- Rationale: Don't design abstractions before understanding implementations
- Decision: Learn from first adapter, revisit if patterns emerge

### 23:42 - ADR-004 Rejection (Skills System Refactoring)
- Rejected as premature - need to understand target tools' skill systems
- Rationale: Don't know if Copilot CLI/Crush/Claude Code have skill systems
- Decision: Learn from each adapter, only refactor if common patterns found

### 23:49 - ADR-005 Rejection (Backward Compatibility Strategy)
- Rejected as unnecessary - project in early stages with no adoption
- Rationale: No users to break, focused migration approach better
- Key distinction: Zero regression (features) ≠ Backward compatibility (migration)

### 23:54 - Next Steps Planning
- Created task ARC-H-0057: Design ToolAdapter protocol and OpenCodeAdapter
- Synced task files (57 tasks)
- Agreed to wait for design before creating implementation tasks

### 23:57 - Mission End
- Updated mission file with outcomes
- Preparing to commit all changes

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `.opencode/docs/adrs/ADR-001-adapter-pattern-abstraction.md` - Approved with changes (removed gradual migration, 
  added doc update req, replaced Cursor/Aider)
- `.opencode/docs/adrs/ADR-003-unified-configuration-system.md` - Marked as Rejected (premature design)
- `.opencode/docs/adrs/ADR-004-skills-refactoring-approach.md` - Marked as Rejected (premature design)
- `.opencode/docs/adrs/ADR-005-backward-compatibility-strategy.md` - Marked as Rejected (unnecessary)
- `.opencode/data/project.db` - Review approvals, task creation, mission management

### Created
- `.opencode/docs/adrs/ADR-002-target-tool-prioritization.md` - Complete rewrite prioritizing Copilot CLI/Crush/Claude 
  Code
- `.opencode/work/tasks/DOC-M-0055.md` - Markdown style guide task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/OPR-H-0053.md` - Add Artifact column to review list
- `.opencode/work/tasks/ARC-H-0057.md` - Design ToolAdapter protocol

### Deleted
- `.opencode/docs/adrs/ADR-002-cursor-mcp-first-target.md` - Replaced with target-tool-prioritization

## Outcomes

- ✅ Reviewed 5 ADRs (approved 2, rejected 3)
- ✅ ADR-001 (Adapter Pattern) approved with critical changes
- ✅ ADR-002 (Target Tool Prioritization) completely rewritten and approved
- ✅ ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005 rejected as premature/unnecessary
- ✅ Created 3 new tasks (style guide, review list fix, adapter protocol design)
- ✅ Approved review #1 and #5
- ✅ Fixed task sync issue
- ✅ Established clear roadmap for adapter implementation

## Next Steps

1. Architect completes ARC-H-0057 (ToolAdapter protocol design)
2. Based on design, create Builder tasks for implementation
3. Create Tester tasks for adapter testing
4. Create Documentarian tasks for adapter documentation
5. Begin Copilot CLI adapter implementation (first tool per ADR-002)

## Notes

Mission focused entirely on ADR review and project planning. No code implementation - all architectural decision 
review and coordination work. Rejected 3 of 5 ADRs as premature, recognizing we need to learn from actual 
implementation before designing abstractions.

Key insight: Don't design unified systems before understanding individual tools. Sequential learning is essential.
