## Objective

Create a style guide document that establishes markdown formatting standards for the project. Should include: 1) Line wrapping at 120 characters, 2) Heading style preferences (ATX vs Setext, capitalization rules), 3) Code block formatting, 4) List formatting. Document should be created at .opencode/docs/MARKDOWN_STYLE_GUIDE.md. Also update the bootstrap/init process to include this style guide when initializing new projects. Before writing, ask the Director about their preferences for heading styles (ATX # vs Setext underlines, title case vs sentence case, etc.)
