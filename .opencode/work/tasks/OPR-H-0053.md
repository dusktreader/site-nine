## Objective

The 'review list' command should display the artifact_path field so administrators can see what they need to review. Current table shows ID, Type, Status, Task, Title (truncated as 'Ti...'), and Requested. Need to add an Artifact column showing the artifact_path field from the reviews table. File to modify: src/site_nine/cli/review.py lines 84-157
