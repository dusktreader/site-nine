## Objective

CRITICAL: pyproject.toml line 14 contains a local file dependency: 'typerdrive @ file:///Users/tucker.beck/src/dusktreader/typerdrive'. This breaks portability and prevents installation on other machines. Replace with the PyPI version. Change to: 'typerdrive>=X.Y.Z' (check PyPI for latest version). Test installation in clean environment after change.
