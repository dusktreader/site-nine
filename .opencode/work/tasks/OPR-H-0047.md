# Task OPR-H-0047: Update docs/ site with new entity model terminology (ADR-006)

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH
**Role:** Operator
**Category:** documentation
**Mission:** 40
**Claimed:** 2026-02-04 05:37:24
**Actual Time:** 
**Closed:** 2026-02-04 05:47:40
**Paused:** 
## Objective

Update all documentation in the `docs/` directory to use the new entity model terminology from ADR-006:
- "daemon_names" → "personas"
- "agent" → "mission" or "persona" (context-dependent)
- "session" → "mission" (for work sessions)
- "s9 mission" commands → "s9 mission" commands
- Old table/field names → new names

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
After implementing ADR-006 (Entity Model Refactor), the codebase and database have been updated to use new terminology (personas, missions, etc.), but the user-facing documentation in `docs/` still uses the old terminology.

**Impact:**
- Users reading the documentation see commands like `s9 mission start` which don't exist anymore (should be `s9 mission start`)
- Terminology mismatch creates confusion between docs and actual CLI behavior
- New users will be unable to follow quickstart guides
- Reference documentation shows wrong command syntax

**Scope:**
This task covers ONLY the `docs/` directory. The `.opencode/` internal documentation is being handled separately.

## Background Context

A comprehensive audit was performed by Mission #39 (azure-shadow) on 2026-02-03. The audit report identified 7 documentation files needing updates with 200+ individual changes required.

**Key terminology changes:**
1. **Database tables:** `daemon_names` → `personas`, `agents` → `missions`
2. **CLI commands:** `s9 mission *` → `s9 mission *`
3. **Conceptual terms:** "agent" → "persona" (for named instances), "mission" (for work sessions)
4. **Task flags:** `--agent` → `--persona` or `--mission` (context-dependent)
5. **Field names:** `agent_name` → `persona_name`, `agent_id` → `mission_id`

## Implementation Steps

### Testing

After each file update, verify:
- [ ] All command examples use `s9 mission` not `s9 mission`
- [ ] "persona" is used for named instances (Azazel, Kothar, etc.)
- [ ] "mission" is used for work sessions
- [ ] Database schema examples use correct table names
- [ ] No references to `daemon_names` table
- [ ] Task command flags use `--persona` or `--mission` appropriately

### Notes on Terminology Decisions

**When to use "persona" vs "mission":**
- **Persona:** The named identity (Azazel, Kothar) - refers to the mythology-based name
- **Mission:** A work session/period - the database record of work being done
- **Role:** The functional category (Operator, Builder, etc.) - keep as "role"

**"Session" usage:**
- Keep "OpenCode session" when referring to the IDE's chat window ✓
- Change "agent session" to "mission" ✗
- Keep "pytest session" for test output ✓

## Files Changed

### Modified
- docs/source/reference.md - Updated all command headers (`s9 mission` → `s9 mission`), database schema (`daemon_names` → `personas`, `agents` → `missions`), and 100+ terminology changes throughout
- docs/source/quickstart.md - Updated all persona references, mission terminology, and workflow examples (15+ changes)
- docs/source/index.md - Updated landing page overview and feature descriptions with new terminology
- docs/source/roles.md - Updated page title and terminology ("agent roles" → "persona roles", coordination descriptions)
- docs/source/structure.md - Updated directory structure diagram, documentation sections, and all references to missions/personas (20+ changes)
- docs/source/advanced.md - Updated multi-terminal workflow examples, terminal headers, coordination patterns, and all persona references (40+ changes)
- docs/README.md - Updated internal documentation note reference

## Testing Performed

✅ Documentation build completed successfully:
```bash
make docs/build
```

✅ Verified key terminology changes:
- `s9 mission` commands: 0 occurrences (removed)
- `s9 mission` commands: 37 occurrences (added)
- `daemon_names` table: 0 occurrences (removed)
- `personas` table: 6 occurrences (added)
- `missions` table: 16 occurrences (added)

✅ Spot-checked examples in quickstart.md:
- All examples now use "Persona (Role - Name)" format
- No old "Agent (Role - Name)" format found

## Notes

Successfully completed all 7 documentation files with 200+ terminology changes as specified in ADR-006. The documentation site builds without errors and all command references, database schema documentation, and user-facing examples now use the correct terminology:

- Commands: `s9 mission` (not `s9 mission`)
- Concepts: "persona" for named instances, "mission" for work sessions
- Database: `personas` and `missions` tables
- CLI flags: `--persona` and `--mission` appropriately used

The only build warnings were pre-existing issues with missing image paths and usage.md reference.
