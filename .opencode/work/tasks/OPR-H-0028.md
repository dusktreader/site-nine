## Objective

Session start and end workflows currently take ~5 minutes each due to manual steps. Create new 's9 session start', 's9 session update', and 's9 session end' commands to automate:

Session Start:
- Create session file with metadata
- Present role selection prompt
- Generate daemon name suggestions
- Update session file with selections
- Display session confirmation

Session End:
- Update session status and close timestamp
- Generate session summary
- Handle task closure
- Commit changes if requested

Reference: .opencode/skills/session-start/SKILL.md and .opencode/skills/session-end/SKILL.md

Goal: Reduce session start/end time from ~5 minutes to <1 minute each.
