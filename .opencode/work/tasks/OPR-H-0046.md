## Objective

Modify the /summon command behavior so it always creates a new OpenCode chat session before running the session-start workflow. This makes /summon a complete "start fresh with a new agent" command while preserving the default /new command behavior for users who just want a new chat without the agent workflow.

## Notes

Research completed: OpenCode custom commands cannot programmatically trigger built-in TUI commands like /new. The command system doesn't support command composition or session management APIs. Updated session-end skill to remind users to run /new before /summon as a workaround. Full implementation blocked by OpenCode architecture limitations - would require feature request to OpenCode for command composition support.
