## Objective

Currently site-nine is tightly coupled to OpenCode. Research what would be required to make it generic and usable with other agentic coding tools such as:

- Claude Code (Anthropic)
- GitHub Copilot CLI
- Crush
- Other AI coding assistants

Research Questions:
1. What parts of site-nine are OpenCode-specific vs. generic?
2. What abstraction layers would be needed?
3. How do other tools handle session management, skills, tasks?
4. What APIs/interfaces do they expose?
5. Can we create a plugin/adapter architecture?
6. What would the migration path look like?

Deliverables:
- Analysis document identifying tool-specific vs generic components
- Proposed abstraction architecture
- Compatibility matrix for different tools
- Recommendation on feasibility and approach
- (Optional) Proof-of-concept adapter for one additional tool

Goal: Make site-nine a universal AI coding workflow system.

## Problem Statement

[Describe the problem or need - explain current state, why it's problematic, impact]

## Implementation Steps

[Chronological log of work done - update as you go, document decisions]

## Files Changed

### Created
- [file path] - [description]

### Modified
- [file path] - [description]

## Testing Performed

[Document test commands, results, verification]

## Notes

Research complete. Findings: 80% of site-nine is already tool-agnostic. Main coupling in integration layer (skills, commands, config). Recommended adapter pattern with 4-6 week implementation. Created ARC-H-0030 for Architect to design detailed technical architecture. Ready for next phase.
