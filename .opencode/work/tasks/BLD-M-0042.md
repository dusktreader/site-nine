# Task BLD-M-0042: Update epic templates in site-nine init to include epics directory

**Status:** TODO
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Role:** Builder
**Category:** infrastructure
**Agent:** 
**Claimed:** 
**Actual Time:** 
**Closed:** 
**Paused:** 


## Objective

Update s9 init templates to create .opencode/work/epics/ directory and include epic README template

## Problem Statement

As part of implementing epic support in site-nine, the `s9 init` command needs to be updated to create the `.opencode/work/epics/` directory and include appropriate templates for epic documentation.

## Context

This task is part of a larger epic implementation effort. Related tasks:
- BLD-H-0034: Implement epic ID generation with priority prefix (UNDERWAY by terminus)
- BLD-H-0035: Implement epic CLI commands (create, list, show, update, abort)
- BLD-H-0036: Implement task-epic linking (create with --epic, link, unlink)
- BLD-H-0037: Implement epic markdown artifact generation and templates
- BLD-H-0038: Implement epic/task sync commands (DB as source of truth)

**IMPORTANT:** There is another task in motion (BLD-H-0034) that will change things fundamentally. Wait for that task to complete before starting work on the epic implementation tasks, as the approach may change based on those fundamental changes.

## Implementation Steps

[Chronological log of work done - update as you go, document decisions]

## Files Changed

### Created
- [file path] - [description]

### Modified
- [file path] - [description]

## Testing Performed

[Document test commands, results, verification]

## Notes

**2026-02-03:** Task reassigned from Operator (OPR-M-0042) to Builder (BLD-M-0042) as it involves code implementation rather than infrastructure management.

**Important:** This task should wait until BLD-H-0034 completes, as fundamental changes are being made that will affect the epic implementation approach.
