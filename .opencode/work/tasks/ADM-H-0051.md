## Objective

Based on completed research (ADM-H-0029) and architecture (ARC-H-0030), create a series of Engineer/Operator tasks to implement the tool-agnostic adapter system that allows site-nine to work with OpenCode, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Cursor, Aider, and other AI coding tools. Break down Phase 1 implementation into actionable tasks with clear dependencies and acceptance criteria.

## Problem Statement

Site-nine is currently tightly coupled to OpenCode. Research (ADM-H-0029) and architecture design (ARC-H-0030) are complete, showing that 80% of the codebase is already tool-agnostic. However, no implementation tasks exist to actually build the adapter system.

Without implementation tasks, the multi-tool support work cannot proceed to the Engineer/Operator phases.

## Reference Tasks

- **ADM-H-0029** (COMPLETE): Research findings - identified that main coupling is in integration layer (skills, commands, config)
- **ARC-H-0030** (COMPLETE): Architecture design - adapter pattern specs, configuration system, skills refactoring plan, implementation roadmap

## Expected Deliverables

Create Engineer/Operator tasks for:
1. Core adapter interface and ToolAdapter protocol
2. Configuration system (ToolConfig dataclass, path resolution, tool detection)
3. Skills system refactoring (separate logic from presentation)
4. OpenCode adapter implementation (baseline/reference)
5. Cursor/Aider adapter implementation (proof of concept)
6. Testing and integration
7. Documentation and migration guide

Each task should have:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies on other tasks
- Estimated complexity/effort
- Files to be changed
- Testing requirements
