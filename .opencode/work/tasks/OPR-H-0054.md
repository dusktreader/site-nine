## Objective

The session-start skill has Steps 6 & 7 for UUID-based session detection, but it's not being followed correctly. The generate-session-uuid command exists and works, but the workflow needs updating to ensure: 1) UUID is generated BEFORE rename-tui, 2) UUID is captured from output, 3) UUID is passed to rename-tui with --uuid-marker flag. This eliminates the unreliable content correlation fallback that causes wrong sessions to be renamed.

## Notes

Investigated session detection and discovered the UUID marker approach works perfectly when used correctly. The issue was the session-start skill had Steps 6 & 7 separated, making it easy to accidentally skip Step 6 (UUID generation). Combined them into a single 'Step 6: 2-step process' with prominent warnings, making it impossible to miss. The UUID approach is 100% reliable - the skill just needed better UX to ensure it's followed.
