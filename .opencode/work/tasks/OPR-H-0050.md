## Objective

Replace unreliable git-diff and timestamp-based session detection with UUID marker approach: generate UUID at session start, output special marker that gets captured in diff, search session diffs for UUID to find exact session. Eliminates wrong-session-renamed bugs with multiple active sessions.
