## Objective

Add the Mimir (Historian) daemon portrait to docs/source/reference.md near the changelog section (around lines 101-154). Use docs/source/images/mimir.png. Include caption: 'Mimir, the Historian daemon - Wise elderly scholar with ice-blue eyes who tracks project history and maintains changelog records.' Image should be sized consistently with other daemon portraits (width=300 or 400). This is the 9th and final daemon portrait - the other 8 will be on the roles.md page.
