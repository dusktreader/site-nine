## Objective

Add validation helper in core/paths.py to explicitly check for directory traversal attacks in user-supplied paths. While pathlib is used throughout, there's no explicit validation that paths don't escape expected boundaries (e.g., project root). Implement validate_path_within_project() helper and use it in critical path operations.
