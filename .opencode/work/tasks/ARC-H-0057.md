## Objective

Design the ToolAdapter protocol/interface that all tool adapters must implement. This is the foundation for the adapter pattern (ADR-001). Requirements: 1) Define ToolAdapter protocol with methods needed for tool abstraction, 2) Design OpenCodeAdapter that wraps existing OpenCode behavior, 3) Design ToolRegistry for auto-detecting active tool, 4) Specify how adapters integrate with core site-nine code, 5) Consider what's needed for path resolution, config loading, and tool-specific operations. Deliverable: Technical design document or updated ADR with concrete interface definitions, method signatures, and integration points. Reference: ADR-001 Phase 1, ADR-002 for target tools (Copilot CLI, Crush, Claude Code).
