# Session: Simplify Dashboard Role Filter

**Agent:** Ilmarinen (Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Duration:** 18:57:06 - 19:01:30 (~5 minutes)
**Status:** in-progress

## Objective

Simplify the dashboard command when invoked with a specific role filter to show only the tasks for that role, removing all other dashboard sections (quick stats, active agents, task summary).

## Work Log

### 18:57 - Session Started
- Role: Engineer
- Name: ilmarinen
- Awaiting direction from user

### 19:01 - Dashboard Role Filter Enhancement
- **Requirement**: When `s9 dashboard --role <Role>` is invoked, show only tasks for that role
- **Changes needed**:
  - Remove quick stats section when role filter is active
  - Remove active agent sessions table when role filter is active
  - Remove task summary table when role filter is active
  - Show only tasks table for the filtered role
  - Display clear message when no tasks exist for the role

### 19:02 - Implementation
- Modified `/Users/tucker.beck/src/dusktreader/site-nine/src/s9/cli/dashboard.py`
- Added conditional logic to check if `role` parameter is provided
- When role filter is active:
  - Show only "Available Tasks - {role} Role" table
  - Display "No tasks available for {role} role" message when empty
- When no role filter:
  - Show full dashboard with all sections (existing behavior)

### 19:05 - Testing
- ✅ Tested `s9 dashboard --role Engineer`: Shows only Engineer tasks table
- ✅ Tested `s9 dashboard --role Inspector`: Shows "No tasks available" message
- ✅ Tested `s9 dashboard`: Shows full dashboard with all sections

### 19:01 - Session End
- Session file updated with outcomes
- All changes committed
- Status: completed

## Files Changed

- `src/s9/cli/dashboard.py`: Refactored to conditionally show dashboard sections based on role filter
- `.opencode/work/sessions/2026-02-02.18:57:06.engineer.ilmarinen.initial-session.md`: This session file

## Outcomes

✅ Dashboard command now provides focused, role-specific output when `--role` filter is used
✅ Eliminates unnecessary information when agents need to see only their tasks
✅ Maintains full dashboard functionality when no role filter is applied
✅ Provides clear feedback when no tasks exist for a specific role

## Next Steps

None - work is complete.

## Notes

Session started with /summon command.
