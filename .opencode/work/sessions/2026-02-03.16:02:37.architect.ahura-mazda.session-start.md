# Session: Session Start

**Agent:** Ahura-Mazda (Architect)
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Duration:** 16:02:37 - 16:10:47 (~8 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

1. Initialize Architect session
2. Review and verify completed task ARC-H-0033 (epic database schema)
3. Add site-nine-specific development instructions for reporting broken commands

## Work Log

### 16:02 - Session Started
- Role: Architect
- Name: ahura-mazda
- Awaiting direction from user

### 16:03 - Claimed Task ARC-H-0033
- Task: Design and implement epic database schema
- Status: Already completed by previous agent
- Verified implementation in codebase (schema.sql, epics module)
- Closed task properly in database

### 16:04 - New Architecture Task
- Director requested: Add instructions for agents to report broken s9 commands
- Requirements: Instructions should NOT be included in new project bootstrapping
- Solution: Create site-nine-specific development guide

### 16:05 - Explored Codebase Structure
- Used Task tool to understand template vs project-specific files
- Identified `.opencode/docs/development/` as ideal location (not copied during init)
- Template files in `src/site_nine/templates/base/` GET copied
- Files in `.opencode/planning/` and `.opencode/docs/adrs/` do NOT get copied

### 16:06 - Implemented Solution
- Created `.opencode/docs/development/` directory
- Created `SITE_NINE_DEV.md` with comprehensive instructions:
  - What constitutes a broken command
  - How to create Operator tasks for broken commands
  - Example task creation commands
  - Why this matters for site-nine development
  - Additional development notes (testing, building, structure)
- Updated `.opencode/opencode.json` to include new file in mandatory reading
- Added as step 3 in the reading order (after AGENTS.md, before COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md)

### 16:10 - Session End
- Updated session file with outcomes and duration
- All tasks closed (ARC-H-0033: COMPLETE)
- Ready to commit and end session

## Files Changed

### Created
- `.opencode/docs/development/SITE_NINE_DEV.md` - site-nine-specific development guide with instructions for reporting broken commands

### Modified
- `.opencode/opencode.json` - Added SITE_NINE_DEV.md to mandatory reading list (line 56)

## Outcomes

- ✅ Reviewed and verified task ARC-H-0033 (epic database schema) - confirmed complete
- ✅ Closed task ARC-H-0033 properly in database
- ✅ Created site-nine-specific development guide (SITE_NINE_DEV.md)
- ✅ Added instructions for reporting broken s9 commands to Operator role
- ✅ Updated opencode.json to include new guide in mandatory reading
- ✅ Ensured new instructions won't be copied during project bootstrapping

## Next Steps

None - work complete. Future agents will now see instructions to create Operator tasks when encountering broken s9 commands.

## Notes

Session started with skill(name="session-start") command.
