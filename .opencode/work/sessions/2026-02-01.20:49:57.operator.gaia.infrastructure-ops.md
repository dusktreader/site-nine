# Session: Infrastructure Operations

**Agent:** Gaia (Operator)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Duration:** 20:49:57 - 20:52:43 (~3 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Session initialization and setup for Operator role. No development work was requested.

## Work Log

### 20:49 - Session Started
- Role: Operator
- Name: gaia
- Awaiting direction from user

### 20:50 - Session Initialization Complete
- Created session file
- Registered agent session #5 in database
- Shared mythological background (Gaia, Greek primordial Earth Mother)
- Renamed OpenCode TUI session to "gaia - Operator"
- Checked for pending handoffs (none found)
- Read essential project documentation

### 20:52 - Session End Requested
- User requested session close immediately after initialization
- Updated session file with completion metadata
- No development work was performed

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/sessions/2026-02-01.20:49:57.operator.gaia.infrastructure-ops.md` - This session file (created and completed)
- `.opencode/data/project.db` - Updated with agent session #5 and daemon name usage

## Outcomes

- ✅ Session successfully initialized using session-start skill
- ✅ Agent registered in database (agent session #5)
- ✅ Daemon name "gaia" recorded as used for first time
- ✅ OpenCode TUI session renamed to "gaia - Operator"
- ✅ Essential project documentation reviewed
- ✅ Session properly closed using session-end skill
- ℹ️ No development work was performed (session closed immediately after initialization)

## Next Steps

## Notes

Session started with session-start skill.
