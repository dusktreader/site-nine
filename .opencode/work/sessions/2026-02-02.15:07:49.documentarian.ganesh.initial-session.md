# Session: Initial Session

**Agent:** Ganesh (Documentarian)
**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Duration:** 15:07:49 - 18:03:45 (~3 hours)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

1. Fix the `make docs/serve` command which was failing due to mkdocs not being found by `uv run`
2. Improve agent roles page layout with smaller, text-wrapped images alternating sides
3. Add s9 logo to the index page

## Work Log

### 15:07 - Session Started
- Role: Documentarian
- Name: ganesh
- Awaiting direction from user

### 15:10 - Fixed make docs/serve
- Investigated issue: `make docs/serve` was failing with "Failed to spawn: `mkdocs`"
- Verified mkdocs-material was installed in dev dependencies
- Found that `uv run mkdocs` doesn't work but `uv run python -m mkdocs` does
- Updated Makefile to use `python -m mkdocs` syntax for both docs/build and docs/serve targets
- Tested fix successfully - docs server now starts on localhost:10000

### 15:11 - Improved documentation styling
- Created custom CSS file at `docs/source/stylesheets/extra.css` with:
  - `.role-image-left` class for left-aligned images with text wrapping
  - `.role-image-right` class for right-aligned images with text wrapping  
  - `.s9-logo` class for centered logo on index page
  - Mobile-responsive styles for smaller screens
- Updated `docs/mkdocs.yaml` to include the custom CSS file and added `md_in_html` extension
- Added s9 logo to index page using the `site-nine.png` image
- Updated all role sections in `roles.md`:
  - Reduced image size from 400px to max 250px
  - Wrapped each role in a `<div class="role-section">` for proper layout
  - Alternated image alignment (left/right/left/right pattern)
  - Images now float beside text content instead of being full-width blocks
- Pattern: Administrator (left), Architect (right), Engineer (left), Tester (right), Documentarian (left), Designer (right), Inspector (left), Operator (right)
- Verified documentation builds successfully with `make docs/build`

### 15:20 - Debugged and verified rendering
- User reported markdown not rendering and images not showing
- Investigated by checking the built HTML output in `docs/site/`
- Verified that:
  - All markdown is rendering correctly (headings, lists, code blocks)
  - Images have correct CSS classes and are in correct locations
  - CSS file is properly included in build
  - role-section divs are properly wrapping content
  - s9 logo is on index page
- Added `md_in_html` extension to mkdocs.yaml to support markdown inside HTML divs
- Confirmed build is working correctly - likely needed fresh rebuild/server restart to see changes

### 15:22 - Configured auto-reload for docs
- Reviewed configuration from ~/src/mhe/assess-crol-troll/docs/mkdocs.yaml
- Updated watch section in mkdocs.yaml to watch both:
  - `source` directory (markdown documentation files)
  - `../src/s9` directory (Python source code for API docs)
- This enables MkDocs dev server to auto-reload when changes are made to either docs or source code
- Matches the pattern used in CROL Troll project for better developer experience

### 15:32 - Adjusted image sizes and removed CLI examples from roles page
- Increased image size from 280px to 320px for better visibility
- Added cache-busting query parameter to CSS (v=1770075678)
- Removed all "Example Commands" sections from roles.md page
- Removed "Starting a Session" section at bottom of roles page
- Simplified to just role descriptions, use cases, and best practices
- Updated quickstart.md to clarify `s9 init` works in current directory (no need to show cd command)
- CLI commands remain only in quickstart.md, features.md, usage.md, and reference.md where appropriate

### 15:36 - Converted images to figure/figcaption for proper captions
- Reviewed CROL Troll docs to see how captions are done with <figure> and <figcaption> tags
- Increased image size to 380px (from 320px) for better visibility
- Converted all role images from markdown syntax to HTML <figure> tags
- Moved captions underneath images using <figcaption> styled with:
  - Centered text alignment
  - Italic font style
  - 8px top margin
  - 0.9em font size
- Updated CSS to use .role-figure-left and .role-figure-right classes
- Images now have proper semantic HTML structure with visible captions below
- Cache-busting parameter updated to v=1770075974

### 18:03 - Session End
- Updated session file with outcomes and completion metadata
- All changes ready to commit
- Session status: completed

## Files Changed

- `Makefile` - Updated docs/build and docs/serve targets to use `python -m mkdocs` syntax
- `docs/source/stylesheets/extra.css` - Created custom CSS for role images (380px), logo styling, and figcaption formatting
