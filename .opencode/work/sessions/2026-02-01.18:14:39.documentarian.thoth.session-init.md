# Session: Documentation Cleanup

**Agent:** Thoth (Documentarian)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Duration:** 18:14:39 - 18:46:01 (~30 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Clean up the docs/ folder by removing outdated planning documents and updating all user-facing documentation to use the correct project name "s9" (replacing old "hyper-queue" references).

## Work Log

### 18:14 - Session Started
- Role: Documentarian
- Name: thoth
- Awaiting direction from user

### 18:15 - Essential Documentation Read
- Read .opencode/README.md - Project overview and structure
- Read .opencode/work/planning/PROJECT_STATUS.md - Current project status
- Read .opencode/guides/AGENTS.md - Development patterns and conventions
- Read .opencode/procedures/COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md - Commit format and workflow

**Key Insights:**
- s9 is a Python CLI tool for bootstrapping .opencode project structures
- Currently in migration cleanup phase (removing CROL-specific references)
- PM script infrastructure needs to be ported from reference implementation
- Task database needs initialization
- Using structured logging with loguru (not f-strings)

### 18:16 - Cleaned Up docs/ Directory
**Task:** Remove outdated documentation not meant for end users

**Removed:**
- `docs/archive/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (1848 lines) - Outdated step-by-step guide from old "h-queue" project
- `docs/planning/PLANNING.md` (786 lines) - Old project planning referencing "Hyper-Queue"
- `docs/archive/` directory (empty after cleanup)
- `docs/planning/` directory (empty after cleanup)

**Updated docs/README.md:**
- Removed references to deleted directories
- Updated project name from "Hyper-Queue" to "s9"
- Added build instructions
- Added note about agent/developer docs in .opencode/

### 18:17 - Updated User Documentation
**Task:** Replace all "hyper-queue" references with "s9"

**Files Updated:**
- `docs/source/index.md` - Updated project name and description
- `docs/source/quickstart.md` - Updated all CLI commands to use "s9"
- `docs/source/features.md` - Updated feature descriptions
- `docs/source/reference.md` - Updated CLI reference to use "s9"
- `docs/source/usage.md` - Updated usage examples
- `docs/mkdocs.yaml` - Updated site name, URLs, and watch paths

**Method:** Used sed to replace all instances of "hyper-queue" and "Hyper-Queue" with "s9"

### 18:46 - Session End
- Updated session file with completion metadata
- All documentation cleanup objectives achieved
- Ready to commit changes

## Files Changed

- `docs/archive/` - **Removed** - Entire directory with outdated execution plan
- `docs/planning/` - **Removed** - Entire directory with old project planning
- `docs/README.md` - **Updated** - Project name, removed references to deleted directories, added build instructions
- `docs/source/index.md` - **Updated** - Project name from "hyper-queue" to "s9"
- `docs/source/quickstart.md` - **Updated** - CLI commands and references to s9
- `docs/source/features.md` - **Updated** - Feature descriptions using s9
- `docs/source/reference.md` - **Updated** - Complete CLI reference updated to s9
- `docs/source/usage.md` - **Updated** - All usage examples updated to s9
- `docs/mkdocs.yaml` - **Updated** - Site name, URLs (github.com/dusktreader/site-nine), watch path (src/s9)

## Outcomes

- ✅ Removed 2 outdated documentation files (2,634 lines total)
  - docs/archive/EXECUTION_PLAN.md (1,848 lines)
  - docs/planning/PLANNING.md (786 lines)
- ✅ Removed 2 empty directories (docs/archive/, docs/planning/)
- ✅ Updated docs/README.md with current project information
- ✅ Updated all 5 user-facing documentation files to use "s9" 
- ✅ Updated mkdocs.yaml configuration
- ✅ docs/ now contains only clean, accurate user documentation

**Result:** The docs/ folder is now clean, consistent, and ready for end users with no outdated references to old project names.

## Next Steps

None - documentation cleanup is complete. The docs/ folder now contains only relevant user-facing documentation with correct project naming.

## Notes

Session started with session-start skill.
