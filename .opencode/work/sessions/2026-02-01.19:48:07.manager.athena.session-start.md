# Session: Strategic Planning and Task Creation

**Agent:** Athena (Manager)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Duration:** 19:48:07 - 20:45:02 (~1 hour)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Initialize Manager session, review project status, and create strategic tasks to advance the s9 project toward a clean, well-organized framework.

## Work Log

### 19:48 - Session Started
- Role: Manager
- Name: athena
- Awaiting direction from user

### 19:50 - Documentation Review Complete
- Read .opencode/README.md - Project overview and quick start
- Read .opencode/work/planning/PROJECT_STATUS.md - Current phase and status
- Read .opencode/guides/AGENTS.md - Development patterns
- Read .opencode/procedures/COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md - Commit format requirements
- Checked project dashboard: 0 tasks in database, 1 active agent (cronos - Operator)

### 19:52 - Reviewed Current Agent Roles
- Identified 8 existing agent roles: Manager, Architect, Engineer, Tester, Documentarian, Designer, Inspector, Operator
- User decided to add Historian as 9th role to complete s9 (site-nine) with exactly 9 roles
- Historian focus: project history, change tracking, retrospectives, CHANGELOG maintenance

### 19:55 - Created Initial Tasks
- Created OPR-H-0001: "Add Historian agent role" (HIGH priority, Operator role)
- Created DOC-M-0002: "Expand daemon name collection" (MEDIUM priority, Documentarian role)
- Created ENG-H-0003: "Make s9 discover .opencode in current working directory" (HIGH priority, Engineer role)
- Tasks properly added to database and visible in dashboard
- All task files created in .opencode/planning/ directory

### 19:59 - Created Task Naming Convention Task
- Created OPR-H-0004: "Standardize task ID naming convention" (HIGH priority, Operator role)
- New format: XXX-P-NNNN (e.g., ARC-H-0038, ENG-M-0142)
  - XXX: 3-letter role prefix (MAN, ARC, BLD, TST, DOC, DES, INS, OPR, HIS)
  - P: Single letter priority (C=Critical, H=High, M=Medium, L=Low)
  - NNNN: 4-digit sequential number incremented globally across all tasks
- Will require migration of existing tasks once implemented

### 20:03 - Created Directory Reorganization Task
- Created OPR-H-0005: "Consolidate and reorganize .opencode directory structure" (HIGH priority, Operator role)
- Goal: Clear separation between:
  1. Prompts/Instructions/Static Docs (agent definitions, guides, procedures)
  2. Tracking Documents (PROJECT_STATUS.md, sessions, task artifacts)
  3. Data Storage (databases, caches, non-document files)
- Will propose new structure and migration plan

### 20:45 - Session End
- Updated session file with outcomes and completion metadata
- Total tasks created: 5 (OPR-H-0001, DOC-M-0002, ENG-H-0003, OPR-H-0004, OPR-H-0005)
- All tasks properly documented and ready for delegation
- Session status: completed

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/sessions/2026-02-01.19:48:07.manager.athena.session-start.md` - This session file (created and updated)
- `.opencode/data/project.db` - Added 5 new tasks to task database
- `.opencode/planning/OPR-H-0001.md` - Task artifact for Historian role creation
- `.opencode/planning/DOC-M-0002.md` - Task artifact for daemon name expansion
- `.opencode/planning/ENG-H-0003.md` - Task artifact for .opencode discovery
- `.opencode/planning/OPR-H-0004.md` - Task artifact for task ID standardization
- `.opencode/planning/OPR-H-0005.md` - Task artifact for directory reorganization

## Outcomes

- ✅ Session initialized successfully using session-start skill
- ✅ Reviewed all essential project documentation (README, PROJECT_STATUS, AGENTS, COMMIT_GUIDELINES)
- ✅ Analyzed current project structure - identified 8 agent roles
- ✅ Decided to add Historian as 9th role (completing "s9" with exactly 9 roles)
- ✅ Created 5 strategic tasks to advance the project:
  - OPR-H-0001: Add Historian agent role (HIGH)
  - DOC-M-0002: Expand daemon name collection (MEDIUM)
  - ENG-H-0003: Make s9 discover .opencode in pwd (HIGH)
  - OPR-H-0004: Standardize task ID naming convention (HIGH)
  - OPR-H-0005: Consolidate and reorganize .opencode directory structure (HIGH)
- ✅ Established task naming convention: XXX-P-NNNN format
- ✅ Identified clear priorities and dependencies for future work
- ✅ All tasks properly documented with objectives, descriptions, and priorities

## Next Steps

**Suggested priority order for tasks:**

1. **OPR-H-0005** - Reorganize .opencode directory structure (should be done first, affects everything)
2. **OPR-H-0004** - Standardize task ID naming convention (enables consistent task management)
3. **ENG-H-0003** - Make s9 discover .opencode in pwd (core functionality improvement)
4. **OPR-H-0001** - Add Historian agent role (completes the 9 roles)
5. **DOC-M-0002** - Expand daemon name collection (can be done anytime after Historian exists)

**Recommended approach:**
- Delegate OPR-H-0005 to an Operator agent to propose the new .opencode structure
- Once approved and implemented, proceed with other tasks in order
- Consider adding task dependencies in the database to encode this order

## Notes

Session started with session-start skill.
