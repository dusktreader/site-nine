# Session: Session Start

**Agent:** al-lat (Manager)
**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Duration:** 12:28:38 - 12:31:34 (~3 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Initialize Manager session and provide project status overview.

## Work Log

### 12:28 - Session Started
- Role: Manager
- Name: al-lat
- Awaiting direction from user

### 12:30 - Project Status Review
- Reviewed current project status via `s9 dashboard`
- Analyzed TODO and COMPLETE tasks
- Read README.md to understand project scope
- Provided comprehensive status summary to user including:
  - Current metrics (8 active agents, 15 completed tasks, 5 remaining)
  - Recent accomplishments
  - Remaining work breakdown by priority
  - Strategic observations

### 12:31 - Session End
- User invoked session-end skill
- Updated session file with completion metadata
- No tasks were claimed during this session
- No code changes made

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/work/sessions/2026-02-02.12:28:38.manager.al-lat.session-start.md` - This session file (created and completed)
- `.opencode/data/project.db` - Updated with agent session registration

## Outcomes

- ✅ Successfully initialized Manager session
- ✅ Registered agent session (#20) in project database
- ✅ Renamed OpenCode TUI session to "al-lat - Manager"
- ✅ Provided comprehensive project status overview
- ✅ Identified 5 remaining tasks (3 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM priority)
- ✅ Shared mythological background (al-Lat, Pre-Islamic Arabian goddess)

## Next Steps

User now has clear understanding of:
- Current project state (15 tasks completed, 5 remaining)
- High-priority items requiring attention (session status, role renaming, test fixes)
- Medium-priority items (image prompts, validation helpers)

Future Manager sessions can pick up delegation and coordination of remaining tasks.

## Notes

Session started with /summon command. This was a brief orientation session focused on providing project visibility rather than direct task execution.
