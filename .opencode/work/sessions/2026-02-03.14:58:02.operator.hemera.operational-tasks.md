# Session: Operational Tasks

**Agent:** Hemera (Operator)
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Duration:** 14:58:02 - in-progress
**Status:** in-progress

## Objective

Work on task OPR-H-0046: Update /summon command to always start new chat session

## Work Log

### 14:58 - Session Started
- Role: operator
- Name: hemera
- Awaiting direction from user

### 14:59 - Claimed Task OPR-H-0046
- Task: Update /summon command to always start new chat session
- Priority: HIGH
- Status: TODO → UNDERWAY

### 15:00 - Research Phase
- Reviewed OpenCode documentation for commands and TUI
- Investigated whether commands can trigger other commands
- Discovered: OpenCode custom commands cannot programmatically call built-in TUI commands like /new
- Command system doesn't support command composition or session management APIs

### 15:02 - Implemented Workaround
- Updated session-end skill to remind users to run /new before /summon
- Updated both active skill file and template
- Closed task as ABORTED (blocked by OpenCode architecture)
- Committed changes with proper attribution

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/skills/session-end/SKILL.md` - Added reminder to run /new before /summon
- `src/site_nine/templates/base/skills/session-end/SKILL.md.jinja` - Added reminder to run /new before /summon
- `.opencode/work/sessions/2026-02-03.14:58:02.operator.hemera.operational-tasks.md` - This session file

## Outcomes

- ✅ Researched OpenCode command system architecture
- ✅ Identified limitation: commands cannot trigger other TUI commands
- ✅ Implemented documentation workaround in session-end skill
- ✅ Updated both active skill and template files
- ✅ Task OPR-H-0046 closed as ABORTED (blocked by OpenCode limitations)
- ⚠️ Original goal not achievable without OpenCode core changes

## Next Steps

For full implementation of OPR-H-0046, would need to:
- Submit feature request to OpenCode for command composition support
- Or request session management API for custom commands
- Alternative: Document the /new + /summon workflow in user-facing docs

## Notes

Session started with /summon command.
