## Outcomes

✅ **Successfully updated all `.opencode/` documentation to reference `s9` CLI instead of `pm` script**

- Replaced all instances of `./pm` with `s9`
- Replaced all instances of `cd .opencode/scripts && ./pm` with `s9`
- Removed standalone `cd .opencode/scripts` lines (no longer needed)
- Updated 12 markdown files across skills, procedures, and planning docs
- Committed changes with proper conventional commit format

**Impact:**
- Documentation now correctly references the current CLI tool (`s9`)
- Users will no longer be confused by references to non-existent `pm` script
- Commands can be run from any directory (no need to cd first)
- Consistent with the project's migration to the site-nine (s9) framework

## Next Steps

None - work is complete. All `.opencode/` documentation now correctly references `s9` CLI.
