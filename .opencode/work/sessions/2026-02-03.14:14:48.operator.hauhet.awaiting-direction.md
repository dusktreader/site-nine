# Session: Created Three New Operator Tasks

**Agent:** Hauhet (Operator)
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Duration:** 14:14:48 - 14:29 (~15 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Create comprehensive task files for three new operator improvements requested by the Director:
1. Review tracking system for task approvals
2. Unified /new and /summon commands with role parameter
3. Fix site_nine module import errors during session startup

## Work Log

### 14:14 - Session Started
- Role: Operator
- Name: hauhet
- Awaiting direction from user

### 14:15 - Received Task Requirements
- Director requested three new tasks
- Clarified requirements through detailed questions
- Key insights:
  - Reviews should cover all artifact types (code, tasks, designs)
  - Reviews block dependent tasks until approved
  - Only Administrator should see pending reviews on startup
  - Both /new and /summon should accept role as positional argument
  - Import error fixes needed in skill, CLI, and documentation

### 14:16 - Created Task Files
- OPR-H-0043: Review tracking system (HIGH priority)
- OPR-H-0044: Unified /new and /summon commands (HIGH priority)
- OPR-M-0045: Fix site_nine import errors (MEDIUM priority)

### 14:28 - Registered Tasks in Database
- All three tasks successfully registered using `s9 task create`
- Tasks now visible in project dashboard

### 14:29 - Session End
- Updated session file with outcomes
- Ready to commit changes

## Files Changed

### Created
- `.opencode/work/sessions/2026-02-03.14:14:48.operator.hauhet.awaiting-direction.md` - This session file
- `.opencode/work/tasks/OPR-H-0043.md` - Review tracking system task (348 lines)
- `.opencode/work/tasks/OPR-H-0044.md` - Unified commands task (293 lines)
- `.opencode/work/tasks/OPR-M-0045.md` - Import error fixes task (325 lines)

### Modified
- `.opencode/data/project.db` - Added three new task records

## Outcomes

- ✅ Created comprehensive task file for review tracking system
  - Database schema design
  - CLI commands specification
  - Session startup integration
  - Blocking logic for dependent tasks
  
- ✅ Created comprehensive task file for unified /new and /summon
  - Positional role parameter design
  - Case-insensitive matching with aliases
  - Backward compatibility maintained
  - Session-start skill integration
  
- ✅ Created comprehensive task file for import error fixes
  - Installation check at CLI entry point
  - Session-start skill error handling
  - `s9 doctor` diagnostic command
  - Documentation and troubleshooting guide
  
- ✅ All tasks registered in database and visible in dashboard

## Next Steps

These tasks are now ready to be worked on by any Operator agent. Recommended order:

1. **OPR-M-0045** (Import errors) - Should be done first as it affects session startup for all roles
2. **OPR-H-0044** (Unified commands) - Improves workflow for starting sessions
3. **OPR-H-0043** (Review tracking) - Larger feature, can be worked on after the others

## Notes

Session started with session-start skill.
