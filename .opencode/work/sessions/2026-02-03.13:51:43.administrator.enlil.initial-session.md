# Session: Epic Feature Design and Task Creation

**Agent:** Enlil (Administrator)
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Duration:** 13:51:43 - 14:13:53 (~22 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Design and plan the implementation of "epics" feature - organizational containers for grouping related tasks under larger initiatives.

## Work Log

### 13:51 - Session Started
- Role: Administrator
- Name: enlil
- Awaiting direction from user

### 13:52 - Epic Feature Requirements Discussion
- Director requested epic/over-task concept for organizing related tasks
- Explored key design questions: lifecycle, ownership, relationships, completion rules

### 13:58 - Epic Design Decisions
- Epic ID format: `EPC-[P]-[NNNN]` with priority prefix (C/H/M/L)
- One task per epic max (or no epic)
- Tasks can be standalone
- Epics not assigned to sessions/agents (organizational only)
- Epic status computed from subtasks (auto-updated via triggers)
- Aborting epic aborts ALL subtasks with double confirmation

### 14:05 - Additional Requirements Clarified
- Sync commands needed (DB as source of truth)
- Documentation updates required
- Abort requires CLI confirmation + agent asks user
- Tasks can be moved between epics
- Epic artifacts update when tasks link/unlink

### 14:11 - Task Creation
- Created 10 implementation tasks across multiple roles
- ARC-H-0033: Epic database schema (foundation task)
- ENG-H-0034 through ENG-H-0038: Core implementation
- ENG-M-0039: Dashboard integration
- TST-H-0040: Testing
- DOC-M-0041: Documentation
- OPR-M-0042: Init templates

### 14:12 - Architecture Task Documentation
- Filled out ARC-H-0033 with complete design
- Included database schema, triggers, data models
- Documented all design decisions and dependencies

### 14:13 - Session End
- Updated session file with outcomes
- Preparing to commit changes

## Files Changed

### Created
- `.opencode/work/sessions/2026-02-03.13:51:43.administrator.enlil.initial-session.md` - This session file
- `.opencode/work/tasks/ARC-H-0033.md` - Epic database schema design task (filled out with complete design)
- `.opencode/work/tasks/ENG-H-0034.md` - Epic ID generation task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/ENG-H-0035.md` - Epic CLI commands task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/ENG-H-0036.md` - Task-epic linking task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/ENG-H-0037.md` - Epic artifacts task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/ENG-H-0038.md` - Sync commands task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/ENG-M-0039.md` - Dashboard integration task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/TST-H-0040.md` - Epic testing task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/DOC-M-0041.md` - Epic documentation task
- `.opencode/work/tasks/OPR-M-0042.md` - Init templates task

### Modified
- `.opencode/data/project.db` - Added 10 new tasks to database

## Outcomes

✅ **Epic Feature Fully Designed**
- Complete database schema with epics table, epic_id FK, and status triggers
- Epic ID format defined: `EPC-[P]-[NNNN]` with priority indicators
- All cascade rules defined (abort epic → abort all subtasks)
- Confirmation workflows designed (CLI prompt + agent confirmation)

✅ **10 Implementation Tasks Created**
- 1 Architecture task (ARC-H-0033) - Foundation schema design
- 6 Engineer tasks (ENG-H-0034 through ENG-M-0039) - Core implementation
- 1 Tester task (TST-H-0040) - Comprehensive testing
- 1 Documentarian task (DOC-M-0041) - Workflow documentation
- 1 Operator task (OPR-M-0042) - Init template updates

✅ **Architecture Task Fully Documented**
- ARC-H-0033 filled with complete schema, triggers, data models
- All design decisions captured from discussion
- Dependencies and implementation order documented
- Ready for Architect to claim and implement

✅ **Key Design Decisions Documented**
- Task-epic relationship: one-to-one or none
- Epic status: computed from subtasks, not manual
- Sync commands: DB as source of truth
- Abort safety: double confirmation required
- Artifacts: separate `.opencode/work/epics/` directory

## Next Steps

**For Implementation Team:**

1. **Start with ARC-H-0033** (Architect) - Foundation task must be completed first
   - Implement database schema and triggers
   - Create Epic data model
   - Write migration script

2. **Then proceed in sequence:**
   - ENG-H-0034: Epic ID generation
   - ENG-H-0035: Epic CLI commands
   - ENG-H-0036: Task-epic linking
   - ENG-H-0037: Epic artifacts
   - ENG-H-0038: Sync commands
   - ENG-M-0039: Dashboard integration

3. **Quality assurance:**
   - TST-H-0040: Comprehensive testing (after implementation)
   - DOC-M-0041: Documentation (after feature complete)
   - OPR-M-0042: Init templates (final polish)

**All tasks are ready to be claimed and worked on!**

The epic feature design is complete and fully documented. Implementation can begin immediately.

## Notes

Session started with session-start skill.
