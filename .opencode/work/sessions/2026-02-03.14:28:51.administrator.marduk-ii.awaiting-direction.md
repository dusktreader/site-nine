# Session: Task Dependency Analysis

**Agent:** Marduk-ii (Administrator)
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Duration:** 14:28:51 - 14:54 (~26 minutes)
**Status:** completed

## Objective

Analyze the current task queue to identify and establish task dependencies to ensure proper work sequencing.

## Work Log

### 14:28 - Session Started
- Role: Administrator
- Name: Marduk-ii
- Awaiting direction from user

### 14:30 - Task Dependency Analysis
- Explored task management system (SQLite database at .opencode/data/project.db)
- Analyzed all 18 TODO tasks for logical dependencies
- Identified epic implementation chain requiring sequential execution
- Created task OPR-H-0046 for updating /summon command behavior
- Presented dependency visualization to Director for approval

### 14:35 - Dependencies Established
- Created 9 task dependencies in database
- Epic chain: ARC-H-0033 → ENG-H-0034 → ENG-H-0035 → ENG-H-0036 → ENG-H-0037 → ENG-H-0038
- Parallel dependencies: ENG-H-0038 → {TST-H-0040, ENG-M-0039, DOC-M-0041, OPR-M-0042}
- Verified all dependencies in database

### 14:54 - Session End
- Updated session file with final outcomes
- Session duration: ~26 minutes
- Status: completed

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/data/project.db` - Added 9 task dependencies, created task OPR-H-0046
- `.opencode/work/sessions/2026-02-03.14:28:51.administrator.marduk-ii.awaiting-direction.md` - This session file

## Outcomes

Successfully established task dependency relationships:
- ✅ Analyzed all 18 TODO tasks in the queue
- ✅ Created task OPR-H-0046 for /summon command enhancement
- ✅ Identified epic implementation chain requiring sequential execution
- ✅ Established 9 dependencies in task_dependencies table
- ✅ Created clear critical path (ARC-H-0033 is entry point)
- ✅ Identified ENG-H-0038 as key milestone (4 tasks depend on it)
- ✅ Documented 8 independent tasks for parallel work

## Next Steps

- Epic feature work should begin with ARC-H-0033
- Independent tasks can be assigned to agents working in parallel
- Consider implementing dependency visualization command for future use

## Notes

Session started with session-start skill.
